# Software Engineering

In this series of pages you will upgrade from coding in a browser using tools like Repl.it and trinket, to natively developing software on your own machine.

For these there are various tools we need to master

* Integrated Development Environment
* Language Translators & Runtime Environments
* Source Control

For TypeScript we will be using the following tools for these jobs

* Visual Studio Code
* Node.js
* Git

These tools are documented so thoroughly elsewhere that I will only provide the simplest introduction in these pages.

You will need to install these on your machine in order to develop TypeScript natively.

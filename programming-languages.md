# Programming Languages

## Machine Code

This is the only language that the CPU understands. Operations and their related data (operands) are represented as binary data. In fixed width instructions which are generally 64-bits long for modern computers.

## Assembly

One to one mapping with machine instructions, easier for humans to read and write.

## High Level Language

Much easier to program, tools support large projects.

The following code snippet in JavaScript, may result in tens/hundreds of machine instructions.

```
let names = ['Mr Sharp', 'Mr Davies']

for (let x=0; x<names.length; x++) {
    print(names[x])
}
```

```
```
